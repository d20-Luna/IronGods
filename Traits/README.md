# New Traits

Links with a carat (^) designate new entries from this conversion, and will take you to their statblock in this conversion guide.

## General Traits

### Tech

Items with the Tech trait are considered technological items and use the [Identify Technology^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-technology) action to identify.

Weapons with the Tech trait incorporate electronics, computer systems, and power sources. Sometimes the weapons use such little energy that they can rely on integrated power sources (such as melee weapons that don’t have a capacity), while others drain batteries with attacks. Weapon runes (as found in Pathfinder) don’t function on these weapons.

Creatures with the Tech trait are powered by or constructed through technological means, and are affected by effects that specifically target technology such as *[rebuke technology^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#rebuke-technology)*. Most Robots have the Tech trait, but Androids do not.

Hazards or other devices with the Tech trait impose a -5 penalty on all Disable a Device checks against it if the creature making the check does not use an [e-pick^](Gear/README.md#e-pick) charge in the attempt.

## Creature Traits

### AI

AIs, or Artificial Intelligences are sapient entities that cannot interface with the world without being installed into a robot or a structure (known as a host). As such AIs tend not to have any listed stats for physical defenses and ability modifiers, much like an [Intelligent Item](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1084)

AIs can also be augmented with [Memory Facets^](/Chapter2/Items/README.md#memory-facet) by installing them into available slots connected to their central processing.

Destroying the host robot or structure does not destroy the AI fully unless all of its processing was fully housed inside it.

### Aggregate

 When an AI is installed into a Robot, the host robot is known as an Aggregate and is modified as the following:

* The Aggregate gains the AI and Aggregate traits.
* The Aggregate's level increases by up to 2, up to GM's discretion of how much more powerful the AI is than it.
* The Aggregate's Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma modifiers are replaced with those of the AI's.
* The Aggregate's Perception score is replaced with that of the AI's if it is higher.
* The Aggregate replaces its Will save with the AI's while retaining its own Fortitude and Reflex saves.
* The Aggregate gains all of the AI's special abilities while retaining its own.
* The Aggregate gains all of the AI's skills while retaining its own, using the higher of the two if they double up.
* The Aggregate gains [all-around vision](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1) if they are in an area fitted with cameras or other sensors that are under the control of the AI.

Unless the processing for the installed AI is entirely within the Aggregate, destroying the Aggregate does not destroy the AI.

### Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrials are creatures that are from a different planet than Golarion. Surprisingly enough, this is actually less common than Outsiders or creatures from other planes.

Extraterrestrials typically have the Rare trait.

### Robot

A creature can only have one of these three traits: Robot, Golem or Clockwork. e.g. a Golem cannot be a Robot, nor can a Robot be a Clockwork.

Robots are Constructs like Golems or Clockworks, but if Golems are the dumb, bruteish type of Construct and Clockworks are the intricate, dextrous kind, then Robots would be the intelligent, sensitive type. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.

Robots typically follow the following template:

* **Intelligent:** Most Robots do NOT have the Mindless trait, and in fact are usually trained in a mental skill corresponding to their functionality. For example the Medical Drone in Part 4 would be trained in Medicine. This also means they are susceptible to effects with the Mental trait.
* **Terrible Saving Throws:** Unless a Robot is specifically designed for combat, such as the Myrmidon Robot, they typically have Low to Abysmal saving throws on the monster creation guidelines.
* **Weak to Electricity:** Like Clockworks, Robots typically have a weakness to electricity with a value that lies within the monster creation guidelines.
* **Construct Armor:** Replacing the *Vulnerable to critical hits* trait from 1e, the common monster ability Construct Armor demonstrates a Robot's weakness to critical hits instead.

Outside of Numeria, Robots may have the Rare trait but within the land they only have Uncommon as many of the citizens there have at least heard of one.

## Equipment Traits

### Analog

This weapon eschews advanced electronics, computers systems, and electric power sources, but was manufactured and calibrated using advanced technology. This weapon is immune to abilities that target technology. Weapon runes (as found in Pathfinder) don’t function on this weapon unless this weapon also has the archaic trait. While this use of the word “analog” is not technically correct when referring to technology, use of the term in this way has become common throughout the Pact Worlds.

### Archaic

This weapon is crafted using traditional methods and materials but is not suitable for striking tech armor. All weapons from Pathfinder Second Edition have the archaic trait. Weapon runes (as found in Pathfinder) function normally with archaic weapons.

### Area (burst, cone, line)

Weapons with this trait can only fire using the Area Fire action.

**Area Fire** [two actions] (area, attack) You target each creature in the designated area with a range equal to the weapon’s range increment (for cone or line) or the designated radius of the explosion (for burst). For burst, you can position the center point anywhere within your first range increment. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a basic Reflex save against your class DC plus the tracking value of the weapon (you don’t roll an attack roll). This damage is area damage. Creatures that critically fail this save are subject to effects that occur on a critical hit with this weapon, including the weapon’s critical specialization effect.

### Automatic

In addition to a normal Strike, you can fire this weapon using the Automatic Fire action.

**Automatic Fire** [two actions] (area, attack) You hit each creature in a cone with a range equal to half the weapon’s range increment. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a basic Reflex save against your class DC plus the tracking value of the weapon (you don’t roll an attack roll). This damage is area damage. Creatures that critically fail this save are subject to effects that occur on a critical hit with this weapon, including the weapon’s critical specialization effect. Automatic Fire has a usage equal to half the weapon’s maximum capacity.

### Capacity

Most weapons take batteries or have magazines to allow for multiple shots. The capacity of a weapon indicates how much ammunition it can hold. Charges represent battery-powered weapons and the highest capacity battery it can hold. Many flame weapons instead utilize petrol, which is sold in tanks and otherwise functions as batteries. Most projectile weapons use magazines, which can hold a maximum number of cartridges. Depending on the weapon, cartridges could be bolts, darts, flechettes, rounds, or other ammunition. Most projectile weapons use rounds, while most injection weapons use darts. Cartridges are purchased individually, at a cost of 10 cartridges per gold. Note that this is separate from than the capacity trait presented on page 150 of Pathfinder Guns & Gears.

### Graviton

In addition to a normal Strike, you can fire this weapon using the Graviton Push action.

**Graviton Push** [two actions] (force) You fire a specialized beam of gravitons at a creature or object within the weapon's first range increment. The graviton beam can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance, similar to a *telekinetic haul* or a *telekinetic maneuver* spell. The graviton beam can move objects of no more than 20 Bulk up to 20 feet per round. If used as a *telekinetic maneuver*, the action gains the attack trait and uses the weapon's attack modifier instead of a spell attack modifier. Graviton Push has a usage of 2.

### Grenade

A grenade is a device designed to detonate after being thrown. See [Grenade^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#grenade) for more details.

### Module

Items with the Module trait usually need to be slotted in another item before they can provide their full functionality. Modules often have different variants, allowing those with the receptacle item to change their functionality depending on what variant of module is inserted.

### Pharmaceutical

A Pharmaceutical is typically an alchemical consumable that is activated by either ingesting them, or having them injected into a creature with the use of a [medlance^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#medlance). To identify a pharmaceutical, use the [Identify Pharmaceutical^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-pharmaceutical) action.

### Signal

Items with the Signal trait can remotely interact with other objects via a wireless signal. Signals usually state their range in their entries and are affected according to the sidebar on *[Technology Guide, pg. 43](https://paizo.com/products/btpy98i0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide)*

### Timeworn

Items with the timeworn trait cannot be recharged and always has the new glitching condition with a value of 3. Items with the timeworn trait are treated as having the tech trait for the purpose of the glitching condition.

***New Condition: Glitching***

Glitching is a condition that affects objects or creatures with the tech trait, and it always includes a value. A glitching creature or object experiences a combination of debilitating effects and moments of seizing up. If you have glitching equipment and take any action involving that equipment, you must attempt a DC 10 flat check to see what occurs. If you have the glitching condition on yourself, you must make this flat check at the beginning of every round.

**Critical Success** Reduce the glitching value by 1.

**Success** You act as normal or use your equipment as normal.

**Failure** You take an item penalty on all your checks and DCs equal to your glitching value or the glitching value on the item you’re attempting to use.

**Critical Failure** You count as stunned 1 for the round. Alternatively, the object you tried to use doesn’t function, and you lose the actions you took to attempt to use it.

### Tracking

This weapon has been developed with several integrated targeting, stabilizing, and homing systems. Attack rolls with this weapon gain an item bonus equal to the listed value.

### Unwieldy

Weapons with this trait are large and awkward, can’t be fired without cooling down first, or are otherwise difficult to use with repeated attacks. You can’t use an unwieldy weapon more than once per round and can’t use it to Strike as part of a reaction, such as Punitive Strike.

### Usage

This indicates how much ammunition is consumed with each Strike you make with the weapon. Anytime the weapon is fired, its ammunition is lowered by the number indicated.

## Critical Specialization Effects

The following are bespoke critical specialization effects for our new groups of weapons.

### Cryo

The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be stunned 1.

### EMP

The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be stunned 1.

### Flame
