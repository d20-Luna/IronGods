**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** 1; **Reload** 1; **Upgrades** 1 (Commercial, Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

An autograpnel appears as a bulky rifle with an adamantine spike at the tip. It possesses 300 feet of coiled, metal cord between the spike and the rifle itself. While an autograpnel can be used as a Simple Ranged Weapon, its primary purpose is that of a high-tech grappling gun, and when used as such, has a usage of 1 charge when firing the spike and 1 charge when reeling in and reloading the spike. Reeling in and reloading the spike takes a single Interact action. When used as a weapon, you may attempt a Grapple check as a free action on a successful hit. You may then attempt to reel in the spike (using an Interact action and with a usage of 1 charge) along with your grappled target by attempting an Athletics check against the target's Fortitude DC (as if attempting a Shove, but pulling the target directly towards you rather than directly away from you). This is forced movement.

**Critical Success** You pull your target up to 10 feet towards you and continue grappling them.

**Success** You pull your target 5 feet towards you and continue grappling them.

**Failure** You do not move the target, but continue grappling them.

**Critical Failure** Your autograpnel releases the target and reloads.

**Capacity** -; **Usage** 1; **Reload** -; **Upgrades** -

A flare gun looks like a wide-barreled pistol, and although it can be used in combat, the item’s primary use is to send signals. A flare gun and its ammunition (a small, rocket-propelled magnesium charge) are completely self-contained and disposable—once fired, a flare gun is useless. The flare detonates once it hits a target or reaches its maximum range of 600 feet, bursting into a sphere of fire that illuminates a 120-foot-radius area for 1 minute as it drifts slowly back to the ground. Any creatures within 20 feet of the flare must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw each round or be dazzled by the intense light for as long as they remain in the area. Creatures adjacent to a lit flare are also blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** -; **Reload** 1; **Upgrades** 1 (Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

Originally developed for use as tools, chainsaws work remarkably well as weapons and are often used by lunatics or those who want to intimidate their enemies. A Numerian chainsaw consists of a weighty housing for the engine and power source that is fitted with two handles, and a 2- to 3-foot-long blade extending from the front, around which a whirling, buzzing chain of razorsharp cutting links spins at blinding speed when the weapon is activated. A chainsaw can be activated with an Interact action by using a single charge, at which point its item bonus to attack rolls increases by 1, it gains an additional damage die, and it is treated as having the [Wounding](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=309) rune, though these effects are high-tech in nature, not magical. You also take a -4 penalty on auditory Perception checks and on Stealth checks while the chainsaw is activated. An activated chainsaw uses 1 charge of power every hour, and continues to do so until either deactivated with an Interact action, it runs out of charges, or it is dropped (at which point it automatically deactivates).

## Monk's Spade

When activated with an Interact action, a plasma blade’s heavy, ornate handle projects a quantum field that contains energized plasma in a 2- to 3-foot-long “blade.” Activating a plasma blade has a usage of 1, and the plasma blade automatically uses an additional charge every minute while activated (an activated plasma blade can be deactivated with an additional Interact action). Half the damage a plasma blade deals is electricity and the other half is fire. Thanks to its quantum containment, a plasma blade is treated as dealing force damage when used against an incorporeal target.

**Weapon Group** [Projectile^](/Traits/README.md#projectile); **Traits** [Area^](/Traits/README.md#area-burst-cone-line) (burst 20 ft.), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech), [Tracking +1^](/Traits/README.md#tracking), [Unwieldy^](/Traits/README.md#unwieldy)

**Capacity** 20 charges/5 grenades; **Usage** 1; **Reload** 1/1; **Upgrades** 1 (Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

This bulky, handheld cannon has a wicked design that can fire any grenade a great distance. A grenade launcher can only fire grenades in the order it was loaded. Grenades fired from a grenade launcher are automatically set to detonate upon impact, dealing their usual effects when detonated, save for their save DCs are equal to your Class DC.

## Plasmathrower (Tactical, Advanced)

A plasmathrower is a devastating weapon that fires blasts of superheated, electrically charged gas. Half the damage dealt by a plasmathrower is fire damage and the other half is electricity damage.

## Rotoarc (Tactical, Advanced)

Rotoarcs employ a moving array of pronged emitters protruding from a rotating set of barrels to fire a series of short electrical blasts in an area. Rotoarcs can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight. If the target is wearing metal armor or has the metal trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty on saving throws against Automatic Fire, and the target also takes 1d6 persistent electricity damage on a hit. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the persistent damage.

## Rotoboom (Tactical, Advanced)

Rotobooms employ a rotating set of barrels, each with a powerful amplifier at their tip, that allow for a series of rapid sonic bursts in an area. Rotobooms can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight. If the target has the construct trait, ignore any hardness they possess unless they also have a resistance or immunity to sonic damage.

## Rotocryo (Tactical, Advanced)

Employing a rotating set of barrels that allow a series of short super-cooled energy blasts in an area, rotocryos can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight. If the target has the water trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your damage roll, and the target also takes 1d6 persistent cold damage on a hit. On a critical hit, double the initial damage (including the circumstance bonus), but not the persistent damage.

## Rotograv (Tactical, Advanced)

Rotogravs employ a moving array of forked prongs affixed to a rotating set of barrels that allow for a series of short graviton beams in an area. Rotogravs can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight.

## Rotolaser (Tactical, Advanced)

Employing a moving array of lenses, this weapon also uses a rotating set of barrels that allow for a series of short laser blasts in an area. Rotolasers can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight. A rotolaser's beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.

## Rotopulse (Tactical, Advanced)

Rotopulses employ a moving array of electromagnetically-charged spikes protruding from a rotating set of barrels that allow for a series of short energy blasts in an area. Rotopulses can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They only deal full damage to creatures with the tech trait, and half damage to androids, automatons, and creatures with cybernetic implants. Rotopulses straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight.

# Weapon Upgrades

## Ectopulsar

Ectopulsars are weapon upgrades that envelop their weapons in quantum fields. Ectopulsars grant the upgraded weapon the effects of a ghost touch rune.

## Gravity Clip (Standard, Advanced)

Gravity clips are weapon upgrades that momentarily increase the mass of their weapons. Gravity clips increase the upgraded weapon's number of damage dice by 1. Advanced gravity clips instead increase the upgraded weapon's number of damage dice by 2.

## Homing Beacon

Homing beacons are weapon upgrades that lock onto their weapons' targets. Homing beacons increase the likelihood of a successful Strike with the upgraded weapon, by allowing the user to roll their Strike twice and take the higher roll.

## Stabilizer (Standard, Advanced)

Stabilizers are weapon upgrades that balance their weapons. Stabilizers increase the upgraded weapon's tracking value by 1. Advanced stabilizers instead increase the upgraded weapon's tracking value by 2.

# Special Technological Weaponry

The following technological weapons do not function as standard weapons, or are magically crafted pieces of weaponry that transcend the standard rules for technological items.

## Atom Gun
Item 18
 
rare
poison
radiation
tech
 

Price 25,000 gp

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2

An atom gun is a cruel weapon that harnesses the devastating energies of a miniaturized nuclear reactor to create a focused cone of radiation that blasts and sickens those caught in the beam. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

An atom gun has a miniaturized nuclear reactor inside powering it, and therefore does not require recharging from batteries like most high-tech items, but if the atom gun becomes broken, its power supply grows unreliable. In such a case, each time the atom gun is activated, the user must also succeed at a DC 5 flat check. Failure indicates that the gun's power supply fails and causes the gun to explode. This destroys the gun and subjects the wielder to high technological radiation. Additionally, if the gun is destroyed through other means, the gun's current wielder must make a successful DC 11 flat check to avoid having the gun explode in the same way. A destroyed atom gun becomes a constant source of radiation poisoning, affecting all creatures touching it with high technological radiation, creatures within 10 feet of it with medium technological radiation, and creatures within 30 feet of it with low technological radiation.

Activate Interact (radiation); Frequency three times per day; Effect You fire the atom gun in a 40-foot cone. Creatures in the cone are affected by medium technological radiation. After the wielder resolves this activation, they take 1d6 points of fire damage from the atom gun heating up and beginning a cool-down protocol, during which the weapon cannot be fired for 1 minute.

tech
 

Price 10,000 gp

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2

This bulky handheld cannon produces a droning shriek when fired. The item constantly buzzes, whirs, and flashes when not activated, imparting a -4 item penalty to the wielder's Stealth. It can be completely powered off with an Interact action to negate this penalty, but must be powered back on with another Interact action before it can be activated. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A nuclear resonator's power is provided by batteries. A fully powered battery has 10 charges, while a nuclear resonator can hold two batteries. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

Activate Interact; Frequency once per round; Charges 5; Effect The nuclear resonator releases a highly focused beam of sound that swiftly modulates to resonate at the atomic frequency of the first target it strikes. Make a ranged Strike, treating the resonator as an Advanced Firearm, and compare the result to all creatures in an 80 foot line. The nuclear resonator deals 6d12 sonic damage to the first creature in the line whose AC is equal to or less than the result. Other targets with the same creature type trait in the line take 4d12 sonic damage, while other creatures take 2d12 sonic damage. If the Strike is a critical hit due to a natural 20, choose one creature in the line to be critically hit, the rest are treated as a standard success. A creature critically hit by the resonator must make a DC 35 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6 rounds and stunned 3. Creatures reduced to dying by a nuclear resonator are disintegrated as per the spell.
