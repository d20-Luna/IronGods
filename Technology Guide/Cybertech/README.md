# Cybertech

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

## Mechanics Overview

Cybertech is technology that must be implanted within a creature's body before it functions.

Each piece of cybertech has an Implantation value that indicates how invasive the implant is. The total combined implantation values of all cybertech implanted in a single creature cannot exceed their Constitution or Intelligence [score](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=74), or they take a -4 item penalty to all saving throws

Each piece of cybertech also fits into a specific body slot listed in its statblock. A creature cannot have more than one piece of cybertech in a body slot.

After a piece of cybertech has been installed in a creature, its bulk no longer counts towards that creature's encumbrance.

To install or remove cybertech on a living creature, you need to have the Craft Cybernetics feat, which grants you access to the following actions. Removing a piece of cybertech from a dead body requires no Medicine check but takes a number of rounds equal to its Implantation score.

### Install Cybertech

The creature must be unconscious or otherwise helpless for the entire duration, and if this time is interrupted in any way, the procedure fails. Make a Medicine check against the cybertech's Install DC.

A cybernetic arm completely replaces a normal arm, from the shoulder to the hand. It can take the place of an arm lost to a severing wound. The arm is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular arm, although cyberart can be added to the arm at no additional cost.

If a creature has two cybernetic arms, they can carry 3 more Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered and up to a maximum of 6 more Bulk, and they gain a +2 item bonus on Athletics checks.

A creature wielding a weapon with a cybernetic arm gains a +2 item bonus to their Reflex DC against Disarm attempts.

When a pair of eyes is installed, the user gains a +2 item bonus on Perception checks using sight. Cybernetic eyes grants a +2 item bonus on saving throws against blindness and effects with the visual trait. A pair of cybernetic eyes can be further enhanced by one veemod at a price equal to twice the veemodâ€™s normal price.
