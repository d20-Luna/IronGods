* [PDF](PDFs/Casandalee.pdf)

As of this adventure path, the 2e deity known as Casandalee is still just a rogue [Artificial Intelligence](/Traits/README.md#ai), and has yet to ascend to divinity, though that will very likely change by the end of the campaign. Her physical defenses are dependent on her current host. See [Artificial Intelligence](/Traits/README.md#ai)'s trait description for more details.
