This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once a torturer robot is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 22."},{"id":"_c6qi0t0yniw","name":"Force Field","traits":"force, tech","range":"","actions":"none","type":"defense","description":"A field of shimmering energy surrounds a torturer robot. Damage dealt to the robot is applied to the force field first. As long as the field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. The force field has fast healing 8, but once the fieldâ€™s hit points are reduced to 0, the field collapses and does not reactive for 24 hours."},{"id":"_6yvzfjthpp","name":"Interrogate","traits":"","range":"","actions":"two","type":"offense","description":"The torturer robot attempts to apply clumsy, drained, enfeebled, or stupefied to an adjacent helpless creature.

On a success, the nanites are injected, treating the injection as its choice of a brown, black, white, or gray nanite hypogun on either its primary or secondary setting or applying the exhausted, sickened, or stunned condition. The torturer robot can apply only one effect per injection, and the target can attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save to resist the effects. On a failure, its condition is applied with a value of 1 (if applicable), and a value of 2 on a critical failure (if applicable). The torturer robot carries 5 doses of nanites, and it constructs replacements at a rate of 1 dose per hour."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"n","size":"small","type":"construct","adjust":0,"description":"Spinning blades, long needles, and crystal-tipped rods stud the surface of this hovering metallic sphere.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"fly 40 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":-1,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":4,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":0,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":1,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":16,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"all-around vision, darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":21,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":26,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"construct armor"},"hp":{"value":135,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"Force Field 40, Hardness 10"},"fortitude":{"value":13,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":16,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"electricity 10","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"bleed, death effects, diseased, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_3zfw9uly70","name":"rotating blade","traits":"agile, fatal d12, finesse","attack":20,"damage":"2d8+9 slashing","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_30uo0ch871k","name":"surgical laser","traits":"agile, deadly d10, range 50 feet","attack":20,"damage":"2d8+9 fire","type":"Ranged"}],"languages":"Androffan, Common"}
