The largest cult following is around Lake Encarthan, which is also home to a piece of Shub-Niggurath: the Watcher in the Bay, the result of an occult ritual designed to call out Shub-Niggurath enacted long ago by her worshipper Ariadnah.\n<br>\nShub-Niggurath was responsible for spawning millions of neothelids into the surface of Golarion during the Age of Creation. Most neothelids venerate her and pray for her return so she might give birth to a new clutch of neothelids.\n<br>\nOutside of Golarion, the mi-go population mostly worship Shub-Niggurath.\n<br>\n**Category** Outer Gods and Great Old Ones\n\n**Edicts** Aid in overpopulating the planet, spread technology among the cosmos\n\n**Anathema** None\n\n**Follower Alignments** CN, NE, CE\n-\n##Devotee Benefits\n**Divine Ability** Constitution or Intelligence\n\n**Divine Font** harm\n\n**Divine Skill** Crafting\n\n**Favored Weapon** dagger\n\n**Domains** Family, Nature, Toil, Void\n\n**Cleric Spells** 1st: *summon plant or fungus*, 2nd *fungal infestation*, 3rd *gasping marsh*, 4th *speak with plants*, 5th *plant form*, 6th *tangling creepers*, 7th *pollen pods*","plain":0,"meta":{"public":0,"url":"CC4oLrdV"}}
