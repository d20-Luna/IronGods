## Drake Pistol

**Traits** Uncommon, Evocation, Magical

**Level** 4; **Price** 85 gp; **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

A drake pistol is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a *+1 weapon*. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d8 damage with a range increment of 70 feet and reload 1. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent damage of the same type as the weapon equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake pistol does not add critical specialization effects.

**Activate** [three-actions] Interact (evocation, magical) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You fire a large, specialized burst designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike with the drake pistol. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the drake pistol deals 1 splash damage per weapon damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its normal damage.

On a hit, the drake pistol provides one of the following additional effects based on its damage type:

  * **Acid** Clinging acid makes it painful and sickening to move. The target becomes sickened 1.
  * **Cold** Frozen spittle clings to the target. The target takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
  * **Electricity** Small bursts of electricity continue to spark and jolt the target. The target becomes dazzled and flat-footed for 1d4 rounds.
  * **Fire** A massive explosion knocks the target back. The target is pushed 10 feet away from you, and if it's on the ground, it falls prone.
  * **Poison** Noxious vapors fill the target's lungs. The target becomes enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 for 1 minute.
