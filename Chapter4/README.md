### C. Mad Paeytr's Orchard (10 XP, Trivial Threat)

- **Creatures:**

- **Loot**
  - 1x *[Portable Altar](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1557)* of Gozreh
  - Hybrid Fruits and Vegetables (Nature DC 33 (master) to identify the effects and ripeness of the fruits and vegetables)
    - *Apples (12 ripe, 10 spoiled):* Eating a ripe apple grants a +2 status bonus on saving throws against radiation effects for 24 hours. A spoiled apple causes the eater to become sickened 1 for 12 hours (DC 26 Fortitude negates).
    - *Carrots (8 ripe, 9 spoiled):* A ripe carrot grants the eater a +2 status bonus on Perception checks for 24 hours, but eating a spoiled carrot has the opposite effect, imparting a –2 status penalty on Perception checks for 24 hours (DC 26 Fortitude negates).
    - *Mushrooms (7 ripe, 6 spoiled):* These mushrooms exude an oily substance that closely mimics certain odors extruded by Dominion of the Black agents, and grants a +2 status bonus on Stealth checks inside of the dropship (area L) or the Dominion Hive (area M), against Dominion agents. Rubbing a mushroom on oneself provides this benefit for an hour; a spoiled mushroom provides no bonus or penalty. A spoiled mushroom is poisonous if ingested, however (treat as [deathcap powder](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=111)).
    - *Peppers (11 ripe, 12 spoiled):* These bright red peppers are quite hot, and eating any (spoiled or ripe) causes the eater to become slowed 3 for 1d4 rounds (DC 26 Fort negates). Eating a ripe pepper enhances reflexes, and grants a +2 status bonus on Initiative checks and Reflex saves for 1 hour. Eating a spoiled one causes the eater to become fatigued (DC 25 Fortitude negates). Additionally, rubbing a pepper (ripe or spoiled) on a flesh valve (see Part 4) causes the seam to open automatically without need for a Athletics check or other action — applying a pepper in this manner is an Interact action.

- **XP Award:** If the PCs make an alliance with Mad Paeytr, award them 10 XP as if they had defeated him in combat. If the PCs can restore Mad Paeytr's mind, award them 40 XP as if they had defeated him as a full-fledged 12th-level druid.
