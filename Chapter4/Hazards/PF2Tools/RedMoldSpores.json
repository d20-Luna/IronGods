The mold can’t use this reaction if it’s in direct sunlight or if the damage was cold damage. Effect The triggering creature and all creatures within 10 feet are exposed to medium radiation. The explosion has a 20 foot area if triggered by fire damage that lingers for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that reach stage 5 radiation poisoning from this source of radiation are horribly twisted and mangled into red mold spore mutants; their Intelligence bonus is reduced to -5, they  gain the mindless trait, their creature type changes to aberration, they gain resistance 10 to physical damage and fast healing 5, and if they were a PC they become an NPC under the GM's control.","plain":0,"meta":{}}
